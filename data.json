I use React.js as my main Frontend development library, I know a little bit about style preprocessors, the one I liked the most is SASS, I also use webpack to package some of my projects and I'm starting to learn GraphQL, as well as fundamentals of relational and non-relational databases to complement my knowledge; and for mobile development I am learning technologies / languages ​​such as Flutter, React Native, Dart, Kotlin and Java, I still don't know much about mobile development but every day I am learning something new.",
